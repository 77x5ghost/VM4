"Description":"Some S213 Sunbursts ended up as police cars, and received the Police Package to be converted. The S213 Police was cheaper than many of the other fast police car contenders, letting some police departments use them as regular highway patrol cars. Producing 350 horsepower, the S213 Police makes an excellent pursuit unit, and can keep up with nearly any car on the road, giving the police a way to take down fleeing criminals with ease.",
