"Description":"The GT is a turbocharged , rear-wheel driven Pessima. What makes this car unique is the combination of a transverse engine and rear-wheel drive. Unfortunately this was the first and the last RWD Pessima in the 80's. The production costs only to make this car RWD, were simply too high and weren't worth it.",
