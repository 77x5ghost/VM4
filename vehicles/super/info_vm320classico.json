"Description":"Equipped with Civetta's 3.2L V8, the name of the 350 Classico is a bit misleading. Released for a short time in 1982, the 'Classico' was the least popular, and least produced Bolide out of all the models. Equipped with new quad custom tailpipes, the Classico did have more power than the stock 320, contrary to popular belief, and was overall a better car performance-wise. Performance didn't trump the car's looks however, the exclusive Velluto Rosso paint and the Alder Royale wheels with whitewall tires quickly ended it's short production. Nicely equipped, the Classico even came with a handcrafted, luxurious wooden steering wheel made by Legno. Under 50 units of the Classico were produced, now making it the rarest and most collectible Bolide model.",
