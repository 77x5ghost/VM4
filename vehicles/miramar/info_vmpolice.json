"Description":"Long before the Pessima Patrol Car, Ibishu produced the Miramar Patrol Car, a small and reliable police car. Powered by a 1.6L I4 that produced 82 horsepower, the Miramar Police Car was not very powerful, but was still able to keep up easily with cars of the time while also being fuel efficient. Used by Japan's National Police force well into the 1980's, the Miramar Police Car has become a culture icon that won't be forgotten.",
