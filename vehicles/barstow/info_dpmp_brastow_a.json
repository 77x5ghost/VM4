"Description":"Gavril decided to launch a new line-up in Brazil during the first years of the 70s. The company needed a car that could attract buyers, the sporty Barstow was perfect for a launch in a new market, the car was equipped with a small 100 CUI i4 engine and HD suspensions for Brazilian roads. The Brastow was very appreciated among the Brazilians because it was the coolest car sold back in the days but it was also cheap to maintain",
